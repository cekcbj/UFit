UFit is workout tracking app with a social spin. There were a few reasons behind the creation of the app. First, I really wanted a way to track my workouts and I didn't want to carry a notebook around at the gym. I also wanted to help those who wanted to workout but had no clue where to start. Lastly, I wanted to have an accountability factor which is why I added the ability of real time updates, so friends could view other friends' workouts in progress.
